From Award #2125998:

- Despite the potential usefulness of OERs, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of the scope of existing lessons described in articles, how instructors implement them, and whether these resources consistently lead to positive student outcomes. This project will address this gap using an array of data sources, from published OER articles to present day student learning.
- This project will address this gap using an array of data sources, from published OER articles to present day student learning. The project aims to conduct a scoping review of OER article content from a variety of journals.
- The project aims to conduct a scoping review of OER article content from a variety of journals. The scoping review will address questions about the coverage of V\&C core concepts and competencies; the use of active learning practices; and the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
- This project will also survey authors and users to determine their engagement with OERs. For authors, the focus will be on how they construct their lessons with V&C principles and how their institutions reward OER contributions.

From Award #2100136

- create or adapt and incorporate digitally accessible OER, including student learning assessments, for six courses, allowing hybrid and online delivery
- train faculty in OER, accessibility, the online environment, and instructional design
- Project deliverables will be disseminated through OER repositories for use worldwide.

From Award #2044189

- This project will also create multiple professional development programs for instructors in which they learn to write about and publish their online lessons and implement previously published OERs.
- These programs will be assessed through surveys and a Social Network Analysis.
- The results will allow the exploration of whether and how instructor beliefs about online teaching change, and if professional development programs can create and sustain instructor support networks.
- Finally, interviews with instructors who are implementing OERs in their classroom will be used to determine how the availability of instructional materials influences instructor pedagogical decisions.

From Award #2230153

- Evaluation of the project will include qualitative feedback from meeting participants and experts across the larger STEM OER community, including those from alternative OER platforms and aggregators.

From Award #1919613

- This RCN-UBE network will bring together a community of two-year college faculty to create appropriate teaching materials and offer professional development with the goal of incorporating cutting-edge biology research and high-impact teaching practices to improve student outcomes.

- Empowering community college faculty to increase student success will have a significant impact on the qualifications and diversity of the science and technology workforce.

- The resources developed by the network will be openly licensed and available in the Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES), National Science Digital Library (NSDL), Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources (CCCOER), and similar open-access content hubs, thus sustaining the resources beyond the span of the grant.

- Professional development will be offered in person at various conferences and workshops, as well as virtually through the QUBES Faculty Mentoring Network model.

- This network focuses on generating materials for and by community college faculty; however, the Open Education Resources (OER) collection and the professional development designed to support the use of these materials are relevant for all biology faculty teaching introductory undergraduate courses, and faculty outside of the network are free to use and adapt the resources for their own curriculum

From Award #2135159

- The project will improve outcomes for learners in STEM gateway courses through adoption, customization, and learner-contributions to Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courseware.

- The project will leverage learner-interaction and authoring data that is captured by the system, and will use analytic methods, made widely available via LearnSphere, to investigate the impact of courseware changes on outcomes for targeted learning populations while simultaneously informing the iterative improvement of courseware by faculty.

- The project will provide tools for customization and learner sourcing, expand open STEM adaptive courseware content, understand the ed-tech innovation policy landscape, and produce policy recommendations for scaling nationally.

- The project will provide access to OLI professional development (PD) workshops; collecting necessary outcome and demographic data; and collaborating with OLI researchers on analysis. The project will create tools and methods to support faculty to engage in data-driven customization and provide expanded contributions from students to learning materials and insights.

Learnersourcing

- It is a form of crowd sourcing in which students contribute novel content for future learners while engaging in a meaningful learning experience themselves.
